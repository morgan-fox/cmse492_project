# 2024-2025 Premier League Season Prediction 

## Overview 
This project will incorperate machine learning techniques to predict the outcomes for the 2024-2025 Premier League season based on historical match data found on kaggle. The dataset will be used to analyze and create new features to train and test multiple models. These models will then be compared to see which has the best performance using metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R^2. The goal is to create and evaluate multiple models and use the best performing model to accurately estimate match outcomes to predict a final league standing for the 2024-25 season.  

## Project Objectives 
- Understanding different trends in Premier League data to identify key factors that have influence on match outcomes.
- Utilizing feature engineering to improve model prediction accuracy.
- Train and test for multiple models in order to predict match outcomes, optimizing for low errors and high variability (r^2).
- Evaluate each model to assess performance and make imporvemets as needed. 
- Use the best performing model to predict a finalized league standing for the 2024-2025 season.
- Provide visualizations to represent model predictions and performance.
